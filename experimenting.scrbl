@title[#:tag "sec:index"]{Experimenting with Languages in Redex}
@author[(author+email "William J. Bowman" "wjb@williamjbowman.com")]

In this tutorial, I introduce Redex the way I approach Redex: as a tool to
explore and experiment with languages.
I also explain some of my useful conventions and patterns, common problems I run
into in Redex, and tricks to avoid problems as best I can.

This tutorial is aimed at programming languages researchers who understand
programming languages formalism, but want to understand how to use Redex
as an assistant in exploring formal models.
I explain Redex in context, by example.
I primarily focus on how I use it to work, and leave most details of Redex forms
to the Redex documentation.

I will use the simply-typed Î»-calculus with box modality as a running example,
because I happen to be studying this calculus at the time of writing.
